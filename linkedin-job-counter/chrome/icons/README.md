# Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain the extension icons:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, you can create simple placeholder icons or use the LinkedIn logo as inspiration (but create your own to avoid trademark issues).

Recommended icon design:
- Simple, recognizable symbol
- Clear at small sizes
- Follows browser extension icon guidelines
- Uses colors that work in both light and dark themes
